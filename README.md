## Team Members:
1. **Shadi Mahmoud**  
   - **Role:** Backend Developer  
   - **Responsibilities:** Designing and implementing the API, managing server-side logic, and integrating with third-party APIs.
   
2. **Ahmed Khaled**  
   - **Role:** Backend Developer  
   - **Responsibilities:** Handles deployment, automation, and server management tasks to ensure secure and optimized performance.
   
3. **Sondos Essam**  
   - **Role:** Frontend Developer  
   - **Responsibilities:** Develops the user interface and ensures seamless integration with the back-end API, focusing on creating an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## Technologies:
### Backend Framework:
We will use Flask for our web framework because it’s simple, efficient, and easy to extend with various services. Python will be used to handle business logic and create models.

**Other options:** (Node.js, Express.js, Django)  
Flask was preferred because it is sufficient for the project at hand, and the extra features of other frameworks are not necessary.

### Database Management System:
Relational databases with a master-slave configuration will be used to handle write operations on the master database and distribute read operations on both the master and slave databases.

We will use ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to map classes to tables, so everything will be object-oriented.

**Other option:** (NoSQL)  
Relational databases were chosen due to the need for structured data, which NoSQL cannot provide.

### Frontend Technologies:
We will use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build and style web pages. JavaScript will add interactive features, and jQuery will help fetch data from different endpoints without refreshing the page.

**Other options:**  
Frameworks like React and Vue exist but are unnecessary for our needs, as native coding with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript will be sufficient.

### APIs:
We will build a REST API that supports all CRUD operations and follows most REST constraints.

**Other option:** (GraphQL)  
REST was chosen because it’s simpler and more widely adopted for many use cases.

## Challenge:
Our eCommerce platform addresses the challenges faced by Egyptian consumers, such as difficulty purchasing international goods due to USD regulations and the lack of localized online shopping options. The platform offers a wide range of products, local payment methods, fast delivery, and customer support in Arabic, tailored to the Egyptian market.

## Risks:
### Technical Risks:
1. **Security Risks:**  
   **Risk:** Vulnerability to attacks like data breaches and SQL injection.  
   **Solution:** SSL/TLS encryption, secure coding practices, and regular security checks.

2. **Performance Issues:**  
   **Risk:** Slow site loading or server overloads.  
   **Solution:** Implement caching and use a load balancer to manage traffic.

3. **Data Loss:**  
   **Risk:** Accidental data deletion or corruption.  
   **Solution:** Regular backups and a disaster recovery plan.

### Non-Technical Risks:
1. **Budget Constraints:**  
   **Risk:** Limited money for marketing.  
   **Solution:** Use cost-effective methods like SEO and free social media ads.

2. **Customer Retention:**  
   **Risk:** Difficulty in attracting and keeping customers.  
   **Solution:** Implement a rewards program and improve services based on feedback.

3. **Customer Service Challenges:**  
   **Risk:** Poor customer service may lead to negative feedback.  
   **Solution:** Actively listen to customer feedback and address issues promptly.

## Infrastructure:
### Branching and Merging:
- Employ GitHub Flow strategy.
- Develop each feature or bug fix in a separate branch.
- Merge into the main branch through pull requests.

### Deployment Strategy:
- Use Fabric for deployment and automation.
- Deploy using Nginx as the web server and Flask as the application server.
- Test in a staging environment before production deployment.

### Infrastructure Details:
- **Nginx Web Servers:** Handle HTTP requests efficiently with two Nginx servers.
- **HAProxy Load Balancer:** Distribute traffic and manage SSL/TLS termination.
- **MySQL Configuration:** Use a master-slave MySQL setup for balanced read/write operations.

### Data Population:
- Start with dummy data and populate with real-time data from partner suppliers.

### Testing Tools and Processes:
- Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure thorough testing.

## Existing Solutions:
Our e-commerce project shares similarities with major platforms like Amazon and eBay but focuses on personalized user experiences and niche markets. While eBay uses auctions, our platform will focus on fixed-price sales with features like augmented reality (AR) for product visualization. Similar to Walmart, we’ll offer a broad range of products but prioritize quality and exclusivity.
